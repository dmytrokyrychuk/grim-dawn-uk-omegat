Go right in, friend. Thanks to you, I get to eat tonight.
Take care.
Welcome back, friend.
Дякую.
Welcome back to Devil's Crossing. I'll let you through.

The Captain said you are good to go. Don't start any trouble.

I've heard about what you're doing for us, risking your life out there.{^n}{^n}You've more than earned your keep. Please, come inside and rest a while.
Дякую.
Sorry, but I can't let you enter. You'll need to be cleared by the Captain before I let you through.
I'll speak to the Captain then.
